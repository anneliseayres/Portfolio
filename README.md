> 🇵🇹 This portfolio is written in English for professional purposes. If you need a Portuguese version, feel free to reach out.

Hello! I'm a Solution Developer specialized in **Dynamics 365 Business Central** and **Power Platform**.  
I have a background in Speech Therapy (PhD and over 10 years of experience) and transitioned into tech in 2023, after moving to Portugal and completing a degree in Data Science and a Microsoft-focused reskilling program (Upskill).

This portfolio showcases technical projects, studies, and educational content I developed during my transition into the Microsoft ecosystem.
