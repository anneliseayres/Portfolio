# 👩‍💻 Annelise Ayres – Technical Portfolio

> 🇵🇹 This portfolio is written in English for professional purposes. If you need a Portuguese version, feel free to reach out.

Hello! I'm a Solution Developer specialized in **Dynamics 365 Business Central** and **Power Platform**.  

I have a background in Speech Therapy (PhD and over 10 years of experience) and transitioned into tech in 2023, after moving to Portugal and completing a degree in Data Science and the **Microsoft UpSkill Program** for Business Central developers [BC Talent Program](https://dynamicspartners.transform.microsoft.com/program/bctalent).

This portfolio showcases technical projects, studies, and educational content I developed during my transition into the Microsoft ecosystem.
