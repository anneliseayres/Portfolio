# 🎬 Movie Database – Business Central Extension

This is a custom extension built for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central to manage a catalog of movies, genres, and actors.

It includes:

- Custom **Tables** for Movies, Genres, and Actors
- **Pages** for data entry and lookup
- **Codeunits** and **Interfaces** for logic abstraction
- **Enums** for genre definition
- Custom **Permission Set**
- Packaged `.app` for deployment

## 📂 Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Tables` | Custom movie-related data tables |
| `Pages` | User interface elements (list, card pages) |
| `Codeunits` | Business logic components |
| `Interfaces` | Interfaces used by Codeunits |
| `Enums` | Enumeration of genres |
| `GeneratedPermission.permissionset.al` | Permission set definition |
| `Cronus_Movie Database_1.0.0.0.app` | Published app package |

## 🔧 Use Case

This project was developed as part of my technical practice with AL, applying the principles of modularization, reusability, and clean architecture within the Business Central environment.

## 🧪 Key Concepts Practiced

- AL Tables and Page design
- Separation of concerns with Interfaces and Codeunits
- Using Enums in Business Central
- Packaging and deployment of .app files
- Custom permissions
